# Warhammer 40k: Battle Brothers

# Scope: 

A text/graphical hybrid adventure game set in the Warhammer 40k universe. The game will include a list of playable characters a user will be able to choose from. Furthermore, each character will have a stat sheet that will be viewable prior to selecting. Each character will have a dedicated inventory system allowing the user to stash and recall items gathered during the adventure. A system will be implemented to keep track of health, currency, and any other resource to be added in the future. A list of enemies will be created and randomly called during encounters. A main quest, as well as side quests will introduced with additional lore to be discovered.

# Story:

Set in the tumultuous period post-Horus Heresy, the Imperium of Man is faltering. The Emperor rests upon His Golden Throne, gravely wounded and slowly decaying as millennia pass by. His empire, assailed by countless foes is held together by a thread. His sons, the Primarchs, those whom stayed loyal to His cause at least, lay either dead, missing, or in ruin. Save one. Roboute Guilliman, the prodigal son, the steward of the Imperium of Man, and leader of the Venerable Ultra Marines Space Marine Chapter. But this story is not about the big players in this downward spiraling galaxy. No, this story is about the mystical heroes, who appear out of no where to save the day, or die trying. And many die trying. This is the way, the imperial truth. They live to die for the Emperor. To purge the heretic, beware the psyker and mutant, and abhor the alien. They are the mailed fist which crashes down upon the enemy. They are the impervious Space Marines. They are Battle Brothers.
