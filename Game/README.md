# Warhammer 40k: Battle Brothers

# Scope: 

A text/graphical hybrid adventure game set in the Warhammer 40k universe. The game will include a list of playable characters a user will be able to choose from. Furthermore, each character will have a stat sheet that will be viewable prior to selecting. Stat sheet will be truncated versions of what is found below in the #Playable Characters section. Each character will have a dedicated inventory system allowing the user to stash and recall items gathered during the adventure. A system will be implemented to keep track of health and any other resource to be added in the future. Battles will have 2 distinct dynamic engagement modes: melee and ranged combat. Most weapons can only be used in certain scenarios, so strategy is involved in choosing how to approach each fight. Psyker abilities can be used in any mode, but come with a small sacrifice you must be willing to accept. Skills for non-psykers will also be implemented and will also come at a price. A list of enemies will be created and randomly called during encounters. A main quest, as well as side quests will introduced with additional lore to be discovered. Each character (unless specifically denoted in #Playable Character section) will have 2 pieces of legendary gear to find, 1 armor slot piece and 1 weapon slot piece.

# Story:

Set in the tumultuous period post-Horus Heresy, the Imperium of Man is faltering. The Emperor rests upon His Golden Throne, gravely wounded and slowly decaying as millennia pass by. His empire, assailed by countless foes is held together by a thread. His sons, the Primarchs, those whom stayed loyal to His cause at least, lay either dead, missing, or in ruin. Save one. Roboute Guilliman, the prodigal son, the steward of the Imperium of Man, and leader of the Venerable Ultra Marines Space Marine Chapter. But this story is not about the big players in this downward spiraling galaxy. No, this story is about the mystical heroes, who appear out of no where to save the day, or die trying. And many die trying. This is the way, the imperial truth. They live to die for the Emperor. To purge the heretic, beware the psyker and mutant, and abhor the alien. They are the mailed fist which crashes down upon the enemy. They are the impervious. They are the eternal. They are Battle Brothers.

    Goffs Klan: The Goffs are the infantry specialists of the Ork race. They prefer to get in close and chop their way through their enemies. That doesn't mean they're opposed to using shootas, but they prefer the crunch of a choppa finding the soft bits and the spray of blood. Mix of Boyz, which are the standard Ork mob, and the Nobz, which are considered the ruling class of the Greenskins. They're bigger, meaner, and greener.

    Blood Axe Klan: Blood Axes are unlike any other Greenskin warband. They actually...plan, and use tactics to in their fights.

    Bad Moons Klan: Orks use teef as their currency. Bad Moons teef grow faster, so they are the richest Greenskins of all.
